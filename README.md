# Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_Iris

I have performed Unsupervised Machine Learning on Iris dataset to classify iris plants into three species in this classic dataset. Here, I have used the K-Means Clustering available in sklearn in Python and Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.

Uploading it for your reference. Hope you have a good time with ML.
